# This script logs the energy usage of this laptop by measuring how much
# wattage it is currently drawing from any attached power adapters. This
# program is meant to run once every 60 seconds in order to generate an
# accurate tally.
#
# It uses the `ioreg` CLI tool to extract the amount of power being used
# by the power adapter in watts, then divides this number by 60 to
# calculate the amount of watt-hours of electricity are being consumed.
#
# Energy usage data is stored in ~/Library/Caches/energy-tracker/energy-log.txt
